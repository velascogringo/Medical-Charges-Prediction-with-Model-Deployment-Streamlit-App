## About

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting medical charges based on various input features. The project covers the entire data science pipeline, from loading and preprocessing the dataset to deploying the selected machine learning model using Streamlit.

## Features

- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Implementation (Linear Regression)
- Streamlit Model Deployment
- User-Friendly Web Interface

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for each step of the data science process.
- **visualizations/**: Generated plots and visualizations.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning model (linear regression).
- **deployment/**: Files for deploying the final model with Streamlit.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.
- **README.md**: You are here!

## Model Deployment

The deployed model uses a linear regression algorithm to predict medical charges based on user input. It is accessible through a Streamlit web application, providing an easy-to-use interface for making predictions.
